    <h2>ASCII and Unicode</h2>
    <p>4. ASCII and Unicode: ASCII is the code that is used to represent the English letters, numbers, etc. Although it is limited because it only supports up to 128 characters. Unicode is the sysyem that represents characters from almost every language in the world, this also includes the emojis and symbols on our computer. Unicode is much bigger and more flexible than ASCII, meaning it probably has a bigger limit to characters.</p>

    <h2>URL</h2>
