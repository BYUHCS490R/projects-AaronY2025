        <ol>
            <li>My Family, my family will be the topic of my website.</li>
            <li>I chose my family as the topic of my website because it is the best topic that I can get the most information for. For all of the different pages I am going to use for the project.</li>
            <li>I will have a form for the sign up for my website, and a table for the ages of the people in my family, the other pages will be information about my family and maybe their hobbies.</li>
            <li>A sign up form, name, email, age, etc. Ages and hobbies for the table. And other added information when I come up with it.</li>
            <li>I will use pictures I have of my own family. And maybe stock images from google images.</li>
            <li>I will not use ChatGPT or another AI system to generate HTML, CS, or content on my page. All of the content on my page will be my own work, I will not copy and paste information from another site.</li>
