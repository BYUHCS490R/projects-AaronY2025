        <h2>Questions &amp; Answers</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Jpeg is good for more clearer images to compress while still making the picture look good, although it may lose quality in the process.</li>
            <li>GIF is good for things like icons or logos, as well as short animations. Making it good for short moving images.</li>
            <li>PNG is good for compressing photos without losing quality. They also support transparency so it is good for images w/o a background.</li>
            <li>Resizing photos is so that the image you are making has the correct pixel dimensions to match the exact size the image should be displaying.</li>
            <li>You shouldn't use CSS because it would slow down the entire page. Editing the photo first reduces the file size and improves the performance on your devices.</li>
