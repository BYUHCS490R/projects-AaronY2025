        <h1>CSS</h1>
        <p> CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</p>
        <p>Inline CSS is on the inside of the tags. Embedded CSS is still in the html file, but is on the outside using the style tag to use CSS code. External CSS is the CSS from a differnt file from a different folder.</p>
        <p>You should only use external CSS because you would override other people trying to work with you, if you use inline and embedded CSS. It makes it harder for a graphic designer to help make the website look nice. It makes it look like all the pages are the same using external CSS.</p>
        <p>The selector is used to target certain parts of text in the HTML file to make it look different. Tells us which tags, get the different color and size of the fonts.</p>
