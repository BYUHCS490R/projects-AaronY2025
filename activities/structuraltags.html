            <li>The things that go in the header are the title and sometimes navigation links.</li>
            <li>Links will go into Nav. The nav has the ability to be anywhere above, inside, or below the header tag. So it does have the ability to go in or outside of the header. The nav does not have a link to a different website, but instead has a link to a different page on the same website.</li>
            <li>Any of the main information and content that you may need for the website you are creating.</li>
            <li>Any lesser known information that people might want to find. This can include the social media for your website/company. Information about where to find you companies email address, etc.</li>
            <li>HTML validation will help you to make sure that you don't have any errors in your code for HTML. You can find it by looking up html validator in your search engine.</li>
