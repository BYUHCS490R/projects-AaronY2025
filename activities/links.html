        <h1>Links</h1>
        <h2>Absolute Link</h2>
        <p>In President Nelson's talk he talks about being confident in the presence of God in his <a href="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2025/04/57nelson?lang=eng">talk.</a></p>
        <h2>Relative Link</h2>
        <p>I also made a <a href="list.html">list page.</a></p>

        <ul>
            <li>2. The root of the website is the page that gets loaded without the path in the url. A path shows the location of a file or folder. Folder names are like the steps in the path, and the file name is the final stop. </li>
            <li>3. The webpage that showes up automatically when there is no file name in the website url.</li>
            <li>4. Absolute link is the full name of the website you are linking. While relative links are links from the same folder as each file. Relative links are easier for people to link things without much trouble.</li>
            <li><a href="https://byuhcs490r.github.io/projects-AaronY2025/projects/profilepage.html">Profile Page</a></li>
            <li>8. You don't need to always put the link in the NAV tag.</li>
