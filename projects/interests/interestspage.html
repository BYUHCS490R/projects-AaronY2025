        <p>I love to play the sport of basketball. I have been playing basketball for as long as I can remember. It was the first sport I have ever played, and the sport I continue to play to this day. Even if I am not as good as other people.</p>
        <p>I also like to play volleyball. I got into this sport when I watched the anime Haikyuu. It inspired me to start playing volleyball because it looked really fun. I don't play as often as I would like, but I still play it on occassion. Again, even if I'm not the best player on the team.</p>
