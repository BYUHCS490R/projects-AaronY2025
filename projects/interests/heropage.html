        <p><strong>My hero that I am going to talk about is Lebron James. He is one of the best basketball players in the world. He has all the stats to back it up as well. Such as the most points scored in the entire NBA, and it is still going up every time he plays. And even more stats that I am too lazy to write out.</strong></p>
