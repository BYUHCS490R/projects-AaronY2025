                <li>In order to start the reasearch on your family you will need to go to the website familysearch.org.</li>
                <li>Once you are there you will need to create a login, or login with your church account.</li>
                <li>Then you will need to start to build your family tree with the information that you may already have, such as family members that may have passed away many years ago, or even your parents, aunts, and uncles.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Now that you have your family tree done, you can start to try a little bit of indexing. Indexing is a way for you to contribute to the family search by using records of deceased people to help others with their family tree.</li>
                <li>Once you have finished your practice with indexing you can go back to familysearch.org and look around the website to find other things you can do to contribute to the family search community.</li>
