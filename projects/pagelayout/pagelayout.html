        <p>The Teen Titans are a team of young superheroes who work together to fight crime and protect their city. The group includes Robin, Starfire, Raven, Cyborg, and Beast Boy, each with their own special abilities and personalities. What makes them stand out is how they act like a real group of friends—they argue, joke around, and support each other through tough times.</p>
        <p>They live together in Titans Tower, where they train, hang out, and face new challenges every day. Even though they’re heroes, they still deal with normal problems like self-doubt and growing up. The Teen Titans show that teamwork, friendship, and trust are just as important as having powers.</p>
